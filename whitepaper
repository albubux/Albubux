Network: BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20)
Contract: 0x4843588e66700eD5E2C4F8BC6f9b61E686d9cDa9 (see BscScan for deployment & verification)
Name / Symbol / Decimals: Albubux / BUBX / 9
Total Supply: As deployed on BscScan (“Read Contract”)
1) Overview
Albubux is a community-driven token designed for transparent tokenomics and practical utility
(payments, charitable impact, partnerships). The smart contract is a LiquidityGeneratorToken with:
• Reflection (“tax fee”) distributed to holders.
• Automatic liquidity addition (swap-and-liquify). LP tokens are sent to 0xdead.
• Optional charity fee forwarded to a configured charity address. If the charity address is 0x0,
the charity fee must be 0.
Presale/Fair-launch: fees configured at 0%.
Post-listing policy: small total fee (initial target ~1%), with a public policy cap ≤ 5%.
(The contract itself enforces a hard technical limit at 25% as a safety ceiling.)
2) What the Code Enforces (On-chain Mechanics)
• Single fee schedule for transfers. The contract does not encode separate buy/sell fees;
one schedule applies unless an address is excluded from fees.
• Fee components (basis points, i.e., parts per 10,000):
– Tax Fee (_taxFee) → reflections to holders.
– Liquidity Fee (_liquidityFee) → accumulated in the contract; when threshold is reached,
half is swapped to BNB and paired with the other half to add liquidity; LP tokens are
sent to 0xdead.
– Charity Fee (_charityFee) → forwarded to _charityAddress; must be 0 if _charityAddress is 0x0.
• Hard cap on total fees: tax + liquidity + charity ≤ 25% (enforced by require in constructor
and setters).
• Swap-and-Liquify threshold: initialized at ~0.1% of total supply; owner may adjust via
setSwapBackSettings(amount), but not below 0.05% of total supply.
• Exclusions & Ownership: owner can excludeFromFee, excludeFromReward / includeInReward.
Ownable includes transferOwnership and renounceOwnership.
• Router / Pair: router address is provided at deployment; the pair is created against WBNB.
See BscScan “Read Contract” for live parameters.
3) Tokenomics Policy
Figures below are policy targets; on-chain code does not force allocations beyond fee mechanics.
• Presale: 0% fees to ensure fair distribution.
• After listing: enable a small total fee (~1%) to support liquidity/charity operations;
public policy cap ≤ 5%.
• No hidden taxes or mode switches; any change in fees requires an owner transaction and
remains subject to the 25% hard cap.
4) Utilities & Roadmap (Non-contractual, No Migration Needed)
Utilities are designed without changing the base token contract. New features arrive via
companion contracts or off-chain services.
• Gaming / NFTs / Metaverse: micro-transactions, perk NFTs, events; SDK for indie partners,
later mid-size studios.
• E-commerce & Promo Codes: partner pilots with token-gated discounts; affiliate dashboards;
later, selected payment acceptance where feasible.
• Payments: selective merchant acceptance after compliance reviews; wallet UX bridges.
Roadmap (high-level):
• Post-Presale: DEX listing with locked LP; publish addresses/locks; launch community
governance for charity targets.
• H1–H2: pilots (promo codes), indie game SDK, first integrations, KPI reporting; expand utilities.
• Ongoing: reduce fees as liquidity deepens (community signalling), publish quarterly
transparency reports.
(Brand names mentioned in outreach plans are targets, not signed partners, unless announced.)
5) Governance & Transparency
• Open reporting: regular updates of treasury flows, charity disbursements (with tx hashes),
and fee settings.
• Community input: token-weighted signalling/votes for charity destinations and optional
fee reductions.
• Security posture: audits/KYC (if commissioned) published; multi-sig for key wallets;
incident playbook for companion modules.
6) Risk & Compliance Notes
• Crypto assets are volatile; nothing herein is financial advice.
• Regional compliance varies; features may roll out by jurisdiction.
• This document reflects what the deployed code does and project policy; for the exact live
parameters (fees, thresholds, router, charity address), always refer to the BscScan contract page.
7) Owner-Callable Functions (Reference)
• setTaxFeePercent, setLiquidityFeePercent, setCharityFeePercent
(sum must remain ≤ 25%; charity must be 0 if charity address is 0x0)
• setSwapBackSettings(amount) (≥ 0.05% of total supply)
• excludeFromFee(address), excludeFromReward(address), includeInReward(address)
• transferOwnership(address), renounceOwnership()
